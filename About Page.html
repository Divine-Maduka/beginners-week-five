      Hi, we are Divine Maduka and Dimpho Mme Gosengyang. We are 2nd year medical students, at the University of Leicester. I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk">Code First Girls</a>. Going over everything from how the
      internet works, to creating websites and version control with git.
      We understand how important a healthy balanced diet can be for nutrition and overall health. However, as students, we know how hard it is to maintain a good and balanced diet. Therefore we decided to use our newly learned coding skills to create this website.
      We aim to provide:

      <ul>
        <li>Healthy options to keep you all strong and healthy</li>
        <li>Quick and easy recipes to follow</li>
        <li>Delicious recipes to tantalise taste buds and broaden your palates</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
